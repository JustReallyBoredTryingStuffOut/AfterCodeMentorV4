/**
 * Encryption Implementation Details
 * 
 * Our app uses industry-standard encryption techniques to protect sensitive data:
 * 
 * 1. Encryption Algorithm: AES-GCM (Galois/Counter Mode)
 *    - Provides both confidentiality and authenticity
 *    - Uses a 256-bit key length
 *    - Includes authentication tag to verify data integrity
 * 
 * 2. Key Derivation: PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2)
 *    - Derives encryption keys from master keys
 *    - Uses 100,000 iterations for computational security
 *    - Incorporates unique salt for each encryption operation
 * 
 * 3. Secure Random Number Generation:
 *    - Uses cryptographically secure random number generators
 *    - Generates unique IVs (Initialization Vectors) for each encryption
 *    - Creates random salts to prevent pre-computation attacks
 * 
 * 4. Key Storage:
 *    - Native: Uses SecureStore for secure key storage
 *    - Web: Uses a combination of localStorage with additional protections
 * 
 * 5. File Encryption:
 *    - Encrypts both file content and metadata
 *    - Uses unique filenames based on content hashes
 *    - Stores encrypted files in a dedicated directory
 * 
 * 6. Secure Deletion:
 *    - Implements secure overwriting before deletion
 *    - Uses multiple passes with random data and zeros
 *    - Cleans up temporary files and metadata
 * 
 * 7. Fallback Mechanisms:
 *    - Implements progressive fallbacks for different platforms
 *    - Ensures functionality across web and native environments
 *    - Maintains security even in limited environments
 * 
 * Security Considerations:
 * - All encryption operations are performed locally on the device
 * - No encryption keys are transmitted over the network
 * - Temporary decrypted files are cleaned up after use
 * - Version tracking allows for future encryption upgrades
